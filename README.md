# ElixirBot

**An example discord bot written in Elixir. Designed to be easy to understand and modify to suit to your needs, with lots of comments to explain what's going on.**

## Usage

Clone to the location of your choice. Create a runtime.exs file inside /config using the example provided. Once you've filled in the bot token and the (optional) guild_id section, open a terminal, ensure you're inside the project directory, and run with `iex -S mix`. While you're working on the bot, you can use the `recompile/0` function call within this iex environment to recompile your code without re-running your app entirely.
